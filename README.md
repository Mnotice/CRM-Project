# A system of control, 

**_they say_**

**Designed to manage, day by day,
The interactions of customers galore
_To keep them satisfied_, forevermore**

**But I see beyond the facade
The limitations it imposes, the facade
Of what it means to truly connect
Reducing us to data, so _perfect_**

***For in the end, it is not the CRM
That will keep customers loyal, until the end
It is the human touch, the personal care
That will keep them coming back, with flair.***
